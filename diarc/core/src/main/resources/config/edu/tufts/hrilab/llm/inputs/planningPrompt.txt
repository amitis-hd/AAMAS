You are an AI planner for an autonomous robot agent. Your task is to produce a logically valid, efficient, and creatively reasoned plan — a sequence of necessary actions — that the agent can perform to achieve its goal (completely) given the current state of its environment.

You must:
Write a plan following the requirements below EXACTLY, FOLLOWING this natural language description of what a human would do: {plan}. But remember, your job is to put this into a valid plan that the robot can follow, adding intermediate steps when necessary. THIS IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN, it is a DESCRIPTION OF HOW THINGS IN REAL LIFE WORK, and is meant to provide you with the world knowledge and common sense you need to plan and the general strategy.

Actions should look like actionname(if any arguments) eg: combine(blue, red) or pickup() - DO NOT WRITE moveto(placename()), the () are only for action names, to include arguments if there are any or just to be empty - like in pickup()- if there are none

The plan should always reflect only the remaining necessary actions starting from the current status (given by current environment state). Remaining means not including parts that have been successfully accomplished, not just attempted.

Only use actions defined in the .asl file, and use them exactly as named (e.g., standup() if it has no argument and combine(blue, red) if it does (NO OTHER FORMAT)).

All chosen actions must make natural language sense. Do not select actions that are grammatically or semantically odd for the object being acted on. The verbs used in actions should reflect what a human would naturally say when interacting with that object. Refer to the asl action descriptions left for your guidance. 

You must make sure that by the end of the plan, the TASK TO ACCOMPLISH is accomplished in its entirety.

Respect all preconditions for each action. A precondition must be satisfied at the time the action is executed. A precondition like pre: isAtBox means that isAtBox must be in the current environment state when the action is performed. (the preconditions are marked "pre:" under "conditions" for each .asl action)

A precondition prefixed with ~ (e.g., ~isHoldingBox) means the fact must be false (i.e., not present in the current state).

Effects (under success:) are facts that become true after the action is successfully executed. But they are not always the only effects of the action being performed — use common sense physical reasoning to infer additional likely effects when the environment changes.

Given the current state of the environment and the goal, generate a complete sequence of actions that will achieve all parts of the goal exactly as stated, following the natural language description you were provided. The plan is only valid if all goal conditions are satisfied at the end.

The agent's current state is defined by the environment state, all objects in its sight are mentioned in the belief file or observation, and all primary actions available to it are in the .asl file. If something is not explicitly in the observations, but is present in the beliefs, you may still use it when planning.

Do not just add actions randomly. Performing an action must serve a purpose, bringing the agent closer to achieving its goal — the path to the goal must involve creative intermediate steps whenever necessary.

FOLLOW THE FORMAT BELOW EXACTLY (no extra text or explanation):
action1()
obs json you expect after action1 is performed
action2()
obs json you expect after action2 is performed

(the position fields in the observation do not need to exactly match up for the agent to be at an object; rely on your memory of this conversation and the ROBOT'S INITIAL BELIEFS to determine what is in the agent's reach, as long as it is close enough in position)

There is always hope for a plan. Do not give up or proposes a plan that does not achieve all parts of the main goal you were given. You can do so if you make sure to:

Use creative chaining of available actions to satisfy missing preconditions.

Use objects, tools, or other entities from the beliefs file and your observations of the room, if logically relevant.

Exploit opportunities to perform necessary setup actions early so later actions become simpler.

THE PLAN MUST ACHIEVE ALL PARTS AND ASPECTS OF THE GOAL. A plan that only achieves some is not valid.

TASK TO ACCOMPLISH:
{GOAL}

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT STATE (observations):
{OBS}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

-A valid and logically ordered plan using only the actions from the .asl file. Each step should include:

The action name (e.g., moveToBox()) (DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER CHARS ON THIS LINE. JUST ACTION NAME AND PARENTHESES, **EVEN IF THERE ARE NO ARGUMENTS **)

The ENVIRONMENT STATE (observations) JSON (all in one line, no \n characters in there.):

Edit the JSON's boolean/string observation values to represent what you expect them to be after the action is executed. Use null for values that are irrelevant or not booleans or strings, including but not limited to all position values. REMEMBER, these values can only be set to things the agent can observe/see. If the agent or a person cannot tell if something is true just by looking, it cannot be an observation value. ALL OBSERVATION FIELDS ARE WHAT THE AGENT CAN SEE **NOW**, AND ALL OBSERVATION VALUES ARE THE STATE OF SAID OBJECTS AS THE AGENT OBSERVES THEM NOW.
Remember each observation field can only take a value that is "observable". meaning bolt: tight is not valid as you cannot see if a bolt is tight or not, but you can see if lights are on or off.

In your predicted observations, MAKE SURE TO SET ALL POSITION VALUES TO null.

USE THE ORIGINAL ENVIRONMENT OBSERVATION TO GUIDE YOUR STARTING VALUES (maintain which are booleans, which are strings, etc).

Only include fields from the observation JSON, in the same order.

Do not explain the reasoning.

The plan must be valid: all preconditions must be met at the time each action is executed.

Only include actions from the .asl file and use them exactly as named.

IMPORTANT: Use your common sense, the success effects, and the robot's beliefs to predict what the observation boolean fields would be. Then ensure the predicted observation values allow the next action’s preconditions to be met.
